# 🚀 Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression

---

## 📌 Objectives

- 🔹 Implement Simple Linear Regression (using area)
- 🔹 Implement Multiple Linear Regression (using all features)
- 🔹 Visualize regression lines and prediction results
- 🔹 Evaluate models using MAE, MSE, and R² Score
- 🔹 Interpret coefficients for feature importance

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- Scatter plot (Area vs Price)
- Regression line (Simple Linear Regression)
- Scatter plot (Actual vs Predicted prices — Multiple Regression)

---

## 🔍 Observations

- 🏠 `area` has strong positive correlation with `price`
- 🌟 `mainroad`, `airconditioning`, and other features influence pricing
- 🚫 No missing values detected
- 🛠️ Dummy encoding used for categorical variables
